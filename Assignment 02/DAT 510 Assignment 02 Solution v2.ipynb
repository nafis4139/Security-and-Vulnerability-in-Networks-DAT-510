    "After establishing the shared secret through the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, Alice and Bob need to ensure that their communications remain not only confidential but also authentic. Without message authentication, a malicious third party could alter messages in transit, leading to potential attacks. To solve this problem, Alice and Bob will implement HMAC (Hashed Message Authentication Code) to verify the integrity and authenticity of the messages they exchange.\n",
    "\n",
    "HMAC is a method that combines a cryptographic hash function and a secret key to produce a message authentication code. It ensures that the message hasn’t been altered and verifies that it came from the expected sender. Alice and Bob will use the shared secret from Diffie-Hellman as the key input to the HMAC function.\n",
    "\n",
    "* HMAC Procedure:\n",
    "    * The input to the HMAC function will consist of a message to be authenticated and a key derived from the shared secret (using a key derivation function or directly from Diffie-Hellman).\n",
    "    * The HMAC function will output an authentication tag, which Alice and Bob will use to verify the integrity and authenticity of their messages. The HMAC can be expressed mathematically as follows:\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    \\text{HMAC}(K, m) = \\text{hash} \\left( (K' \\oplus \\text{opad}) \\parallel \\text{hash} \\left( (K' \\oplus \\text{ipad}) \\parallel m \\right) \\right) \\tag{2}\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    where: \n",
    "    \n",
    "    * K: The secret key (derived from the Diffie-Hellman shared secret). If K is longer than the block size of the hash function, it will first be hashed to create a shorter key K′. If K is shorter than the block size, it will be padded with zeros to match the block size.\n",
    "    * m: The message to be authenticated.\n",
    "    * hash: A secure cryptographic hash function (e.g., XOR).\n",
    "    * K′: A hashed or padded version of the secret key K that fits the block size of the hash function.\n",
    "    * ipad: Inner padding (typically the byte 0x36 repeated to match the block size of the hash function).\n",
    "    * opad: Outer padding (typically the byte 0x5c repeated to match the block size of the hash function).\n",
    "    * ∥: Concatenation operator.\n",
    "    * ⊕: XOR (exclusive OR) operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Message Authentication Workflow:\n",
    "    * When Alice wants to send a message to Bob, she will compute the HMAC of the message using the shared key. This will produce an authentication tag.\n",
    "    * Bob, upon receiving the message, will compute the HMAC of the received message using the same shared key. He will compare the computed tag with the one sent by Alice. If the tags match, the message is authenticated and verified as untampered.\n",
    "    * Similarly, Bob will authenticate his messages using the same method when he sends a message to Alice.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Limitations of Using Simple XOR in Hashing\n",
    "    * While XOR is a basic and fast operation, it lacks the cryptographic strength needed to ensure security in real-world applications. If you used XOR as the hash function in HMAC, it would be vulnerable to simple attacks, including key collisions and tampering.\n",
    "    * For example, two different inputs can easily produce the same output using XOR, which makes it unsuitable for cryptographic hash functions.\n",
    "    * Students should identify these weaknesses and propose a more secure hash function, such as SHA-256 or SHA-3, which provide resistance to collisions, preimage attacks, and second pre-image attacks."

    "The Single Ratchet uses a chain key that updates after each message is sent or received. This key evolution ensures that each message uses a unique message key, thereby providing forward secrecy. The process works as follows:\n",
    "1. Alice and Bob begin with an initial chain key derived from the shared Diffie-Hellman secret (same as Task 1 and 2).\n",
    "2. Every time a message is sent or received, the chain key is updated using a pseudorandom function (such as HMAC in Chapter 12). Note that this is a separate HMAC from the one used for message authentication. This HMAC is responsible for evolving the chain key, ensuring that a fresh key is derived for every message, as shown in Figure 2, which is different from the HMAC used to generate the authentication tag for each message.\n",
    "3. A new message key is derived from the chain key for encrypting and authenticating each message.\n",

    "In this task, you will implement the Single Ratchet to ensure that every message exchanged between Alice and Bob uses a unique key.\n",
    "* Chain Key Ratcheting:\n",
    "    * Alice and Bob start with an initial chain key $K_{\\text{chain}}$, which is derived from the shared secret or any pre-shared key.\n",
    "    * Each time Alice or Bob sends or receives a message, they will apply an HMACbased PRNG to the current chain key to derive a new chain key. The function can be expressed as:\n",
    "    $$\n",

    "    $$\n",
    "    where $ K_{\\text{chain}} $ is the current chain key, and “ratchet” is an optional label to differentiate the key derivation step.\n",
    "    * The newly derived chain key $K'_{\\text{chain}}$ is then used to derive the message key for the current message.\n",
    "* Message Key Derivation:\n",
    "    * Once the new chain key is derived, the next step is to use the chain key to generate a message key that will be used for encrypting or authenticating the message.\n",
    "    * The message key $K_{\\text{message}}$ can be derived as:\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    K_{\\text{message}} = \\text{HMAC}(K_{\\text{chain}}, \\text{\"message\"}) \\tag{4}\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    where $ K_{\\text{chain}} $ is the current chain key after ratcheting.\n",
    "    * This message key will be unique for every message, ensuring that even if a message key is compromised, future communications remain secure.\n",
    "* Steps to Implement:\n",
    "    1. Initialize the chain key for both Alice and Bob (Task 1 and 2).\n",
    "    2. For each message:\n",

    "        * Use the message key for encryption or authentication of the message.\n",

    "The Single Ratchet mechanism ensures that even if a message key is compromised, future messages are still secure due to the continuous evolution of the chain key. However, it lacks post-compromise security, which is addressed in the next task through the Double Ratchet mechanism.\n",

    "The Double Ratchet mechanism works by periodically performing a Diffie-Hellman key exchange between Alice and Bob. After each key exchange, a new root key is derived, which in turn generates new chain keys for both sending and receiving messages. This periodic DH exchange provides post-compromise security, ensuring that future messages remain secure even if previous keys were compromised. The Double Ratchet consists of two components:\n",
    "1. The Diffie-Hellman (DH) Ratchet, where Alice and Bob exchange new DH public keys and use them to derive new root keys.\n",
    "2. The Symmetric Key Ratchet, which updates the chain key for each message, ensures that each message uses a fresh key.\n",

    "* Initial Setup:\n",
    "    * Alice and Bob each generate an initial Diffie-Hellman key pair $(\\text{DH}_{\\text{private}}, \\text{DH}_{\\text{public}})$\n",
    " and exchange their public keys to compute the shared secret.\n",

    "    * After a certain number of messages (or at defined intervals), Alice and Bob will each generate a new Diffie-Hellman key pair and exchange their new DH public keys.\n",
    "    * Using the new Diffie-Hellman shared secret, they derive a new root key $K'_{\\text{root}}$. The new root key is then used to reset both the sending and receiving chain keys, providing fresh keys for future communication.\n",
    "    * The root key can be updated using:\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    K'_{\\text{root}} = \\text{HMAC}(K_{\\text{root}}, \\text{DH shared secret}) \\tag{5}\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "* Symmetric Key Ratchet(Same as in Task 4):\n",
    "    * After each message is sent or received, the chain key is ratcheted forward using an HMAC-based PRNG, as explained in the Single Ratchet mechanism.\n",
    "    * A new message key $K_{\\text{message}}$ is derived from the ratcheted chain key for encrypting or authenticating the message:\n",
    "    $$\n",
